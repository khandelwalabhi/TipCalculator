# TipCalculator
## GDSC ANDROID STUDY JAM DAY- 2

The purpose of this application was to calculate a tip for a worker based on his or her performance. This application was built using Kotlin as the core programming language for Android development.<br>

During Android Study Jams, we created an application that served the same purpose.
